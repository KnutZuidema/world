# Contributing

The `world` project holds many subprojects. A large percentage of these rely on at least one other package in this project.

## Criteria for a Good Pull Request

1. You made a branch off of `master` that has a descriptive name.
2. You incremented the version number in both the `VERSION` and `CHANGELOG.md` files.
3. You described your changes in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
4. Your pull request is contained to a single issue or topic.
5. You described your change in the description of your pull request.

## What happens if my version number conflicts with someone else's?

Ultimately, I (@BenOvermyer) am responsible for managing that conflict. Just increment the version and let me deal with the merge issues.
