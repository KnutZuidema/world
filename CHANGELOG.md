## 0.2.0 (2019-06-25)

This version moves to using manual semantic versioning. The previous
scheme used 0.1.X versioning, where X was the CircleCI build number.

The version number 0.2.0 was chosen to differentiate it from that
process.

### Change List

- Tag the current version of the World API as v0.2.0
- Update the CI/CD configuration for CircleCI to reflect the new scheme
- Add the git commit hash as an additional Docker image tag
